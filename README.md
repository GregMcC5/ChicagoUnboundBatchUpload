# Chicago Unbound Batch Tool

## Project Overview

**Chicago Unbound Batch Tool** is an application designed to streamline the annual batch upload of Law School faculty scholarly outputs to [Chicago Unbound](https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/), the University of Chicago Law Schoolâ€™s institutional repository. This tool automates the conversion of LawCites CSV exports into the XLS format required for submission, maps and cleans metadata, and improves data quality and efficiency. It features a simple GUIT for ease of use.

This tool was developed by Gregory McCollum, the D'Angelo Law Library's Metadata & Repository Librarian. It was developed in late 2024 and initiatlly deployed in late 2025.


## Features

- **Data Mapping:** Converts LawCites CSV reports to Digital Commons XLS batch upload spreadsheets, handling complex field mapping.
- **GUI Interface:** User-friendly graphical menu for selecting publication type and input/export paths.
- **Encoding Error Prevention**: Identifies non-ASCII characters for review.
- **Catalog Linking:** Automatically generates links to UChicago Library catalog holdings when bib numbers are present.
- **Link Validation:** Validates external resource links verifies HTTP status, and prompts user action if ambiguous.
- **Duplication Prevention:** Detects and isolates potential duplicate content using fuzzy matching.
